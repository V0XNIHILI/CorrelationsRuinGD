# CorrelationsRuinGD

The codebase for reproducing the simulations for the paper titled: "Correlations are ruining your gradient descent"

The codebase is setup for use with wandb for simulation tracking. To run an example of the feedback alignment algorithm, training a convolutional neural network, with decorrelation, upon the CIFAR10 dataset run:

``` 
python run.py
```

The virtual environment setup required to run this code is provided (for anaconda) in 'environment.yml'.
